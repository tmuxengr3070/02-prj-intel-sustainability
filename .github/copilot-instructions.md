## Prompt 1
I am designing an interactive webpage that presents Intel’s sustainability goals in a timeline format. Generate code for the website layout, including the following sections like - e.g. hero and timeline cards. Define the hero section Intel-branded background, main heading, subheading, description and logo with proper sizing, placement, and background color contrast. Add the timeline card images below the hero section with proper spacing: 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, 4.jpg, 5.jpg, 6.jpg and 7.jpg including the h2, h3 and p tags center aligned above each timeline card image. Ensure timeline cards section with h2, h3 and p tags scroll horizontally on large screens and stack vertically on smaller screens. Use Flexbox to align the timeline cards and create a responsive layout.

Add spacing between each timeline card to match Intel’s aesthetic. Use comments in the code to explain each section and styling choice. Make timeline cards reveal p tags only on hover for interactivity.
